"""Filesystem lock primitive scout for Modal Volumes.

Tests three lock primitives against a Modal Volume to see which (if
any) provide cross-container mutual exclusion:

1.  ``fcntl.flock(LOCK_EX)`` — the POSIX advisory lock. Fails on
    Modal Volumes because each container has its own kernel and the
    volume backend doesn't propagate lock state between them. Tested
    for completeness and to produce evidence for the PRD.

2.  ``os.mkdir`` — the classic "mkdir as a mutex" pattern. POSIX
    mandates that `mkdir` on an existing directory raises EEXIST,
    and this is atomic on local filesystems. Question is whether
    Modal's distributed volume backend serializes metadata creation
    across containers or whether each container's mkdir is
    independent.

3.  ``os.link`` — atomic-rename-lock pattern. Hard-linking a fresh
    unique source file to a shared lock path is POSIX-atomic; the
    link either succeeds (you own the lock) or raises EEXIST. Same
    cross-container question as ``os.mkdir``.

Run with:

    modal run apps/delulu_sandbox_modal/tools/verify_flock.py::verify

The scout runs all three tests in sequence (clearing state between
them) and prints a summary. If *any* primitive passes, use it in
``repo_provisioner.py``. If *none* pass, pivot to ``modal.Dict`` for
cross-container coordination — filesystem-based locks are a dead
end on Modal Volumes and no amount of atomic primitives will fix
it, because the volume itself is commit/reload-synced, not live.

Shape of each test:

- Three workers spawned concurrently via ``.map()``, each holding
  the lock for ``HOLD_SECONDS``.
- Check two independent signals:
    - **Non-overlapping enter/exit windows** (each worker's enter
      must be ≥ previous worker's exit, with clock-skew tolerance)
    - **Total wall clock** (should be ≥ ``NUM_WORKERS * HOLD_SECONDS``;
      if workers ran in parallel instead of serializing, total will
      be ~``HOLD_SECONDS`` regardless of worker count)
- Both must agree for PASS.

Shares the production ``claude-workspaces`` volume on purpose —
tests filesystem semantics against the exact backend the repo
provisioner will use, not a synthetic test volume. State is written
to ``/vol/.flock-scout/`` and cleaned up between tests and at the
end, so production data (``/vol/workspaces/*``, ``/vol/repo-cache/*``)
is untouched.
