"""Discord slash command handlers for repo binding and admin allowlist management.

Five commands ship in Phase 3:

- ``/setrepo repo:<owner>/<repo> ref:<HEAD>`` — bind the current
  channel to a repo. User-facing, no permission gate, but rejects
  any repo not on the server's allowlist (set via
  ``/admin_addrepo`` below).
- ``/unsetrepo`` — clear the current channel's binding.
- ``/admin_addrepo repo:<owner>/<repo>`` — admin only. Validates
  the repo via the sandbox-side ``validate_repo_access`` Modal
  function and adds it to this server's allowlist tagged with its
  visibility (``public`` / ``private``).
- ``/admin_removerepo repo:<owner>/<repo>`` — admin only.
  Autocomplete-fed remove from the allowlist.
- ``/admin_listrepos`` — admin only. Show the current allowlist.

All admin commands are gated via
``@app_commands.default_permissions(manage_guild=True)``, which
Discord enforces server-side: unprivileged users don't even see
these commands in the autocomplete list, and even if they tried
to invoke them via a raw interaction, Discord would reject before
the handler runs.

**Why a sandbox-side Modal function instead of an HTTP probe from
the bot?** Validating private repos requires the ``github-pat``
Modal secret. The sandbox image has both git and the secret
mounted; the bot image is ``python:3.14-slim`` with neither.
Routing validation through ``validate_repo_access.remote()``
keeps the secret-mount surface to one container type and lets the
probe use ``git ls-remote`` directly — same operation Claude Code
will eventually perform on the same repo. See
``prd/private-repos.md`` "User decisions locked in" for the
locked-in choice.

**Repo identity format.** Slash commands accept ``owner/repo``
short form and the allowlist stores the same. ``RepoConfig``
stores the full URL (``https://github.com/owner/repo``)
reconstructed at bind time, because that's what the sandbox needs
for ``git clone``. The display side (LiveStatus repo subtitle)
parses ``owner/repo`` back out of the full URL — see
``streaming._short_repo_name``.
