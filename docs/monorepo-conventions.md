# Monorepo conventions

How linting, testing, CI, and deploys work across the two (and a half)
independent Python projects that share this git tree. Written because
the "multi-pyproject monorepo" pattern has some non-obvious gotchas,
and they will bite you the first time a ruff drift or a skipped CI
job blocks a merge.

## The layout

```

├── finetune.py                ← Python project #3 (archived LoRA code)
├── pyproject.toml              (root — for LoRA, NOT a workspace root)
├── docs/                       cross-project docs (this file lives here)
├── prd/                        plan docs for work-in-flight
├── .pre-commit-config.yaml
├── .github/workflows/delulu-deploy.yaml
└── Makefile                    thin dispatcher, `make -C apps/X ...`
```

The important non-obvious thing: **there is no workspace root**. The
top-level `pyproject.toml` only exists because of the LoRA code at the
root; it does NOT declare the `apps/*` directories as workspace
members. `uv sync` from the repo root does nothing useful for delulu.

Each `apps/*` directory is an **independent Python project**: own
`pyproject.toml`, own `uv.lock`, own `.venv`, own `Makefile`, own
`tests/`, own ruff rules (target-version, line-length, rule set).
You could `cp -r apps/delulu_discord /some/other/repo` and it would
build there untouched. The only thing the monorepo actually shares is
the git history and the CI workflow file.

## Four layers, four scopes

The mental model that makes everything else fall into place:

| Layer | Scope | How it identifies "this app" | Config source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pre-commit` (local) | One file, at commit time | `files:` / `exclude:` globs in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` | Hook version pinned in pre-commit config; ruff itself reads the **nearest** `pyproject.toml` walking up from the file |
| `make -C apps/X` (local) | One whole app directory | Explicit `cd` via `make -C` | The app's own `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock` + `.venv` |
| GH Actions CI | Changed files across a PR | `dorny/paths-filter` → `changes` job outputs → per-app job `if:` + `defaults.run.working-directory` | The app's own `pyproject.toml` (same as local, on a fresh runner) |
| Branch protection | The PR as a whole | Required status checks by name | GitHub's branch-rule UI |

Each layer answers "what work does this file belong to?" differently,
and they all have to agree for the pipeline to be coherent.

## pre-commit in this monorepo

`pre-commit` is a git hook runner. It doesn't know about venvs or
`uv run`. When you `git commit`:

1. Git calls `.git/hooks/pre-commit` (installed by
   `pre-commit install` — **one-time setup per clone, not
   automatic**).
2. That script hands the list of **staged files** to pre-commit.
3. pre-commit walks `.pre-commit-config.yaml` top-to-bottom. For each
   hook, it filters the file list by `files:` / `exclude:` globs.
4. If any files match, it invokes the hook binary with those files
   as arguments.

Our config has two ruff hooks scoped by path:

- **Modern ruff** (`v0.15.10`), `files: ^apps/.*\.py$` — runs on
  everything under `apps/`.
- **Legacy ruff** (`v0.0.275`), `exclude: ^apps/` — runs on
  everything OUTSIDE `apps/` (the archived LoRA code at the root).

The key detail: pre-commit's ruff binary lives in its own isolated
env, managed by pre-commit. It is NOT the ruff from
`apps/delulu_discord/.venv`. But when that ruff runs on a file, **ruff
itself** walks up from the file looking for a `pyproject.toml`, finds
`apps/delulu_discord/pyproject.toml`, and uses THAT config
(`target-version`, `line-length`, `[tool.ruff.lint]`, etc.). So the
ruff *version* is shared across both apps, but the *rules* are
per-app.

### The version-drift trap

`.pre-commit-config.yaml` pins `rev: v0.15.10`. Each
`apps/*/pyproject.toml` pins `ruff>=0.15` in its dev extras. Today
they agree. Tomorrow someone bumps one app to `ruff>=0.16` without
touching `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and you'll see:

- Local `uv run ruff` (from the app's venv) uses `0.16.x`
- Local `pre-commit run` uses `0.15.10` (from the pre-commit pin)
- Same file, different opinions, mysterious CI flakes

**Rule:** when bumping the ruff pin in any app's `pyproject.toml`,
bump `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in the same commit. Same for any other
tool that's pinned in both places.

## GH Actions CI in this monorepo

CI doesn't share pre-commit's per-file model. It operates at the
**job** level, and each job has a `working-directory`.

The workflow at `.github/workflows/delulu-deploy.yaml` has one job
per app per phase:

- `delulu-discord-ci` — ruff + pytest, `working-directory: apps/delulu_discord`
- `delulu-sandbox-modal-ci` — ruff + pytest, `working-directory: apps/delulu_sandbox_modal`
- `delulu-sandbox-modal-deploy` — `modal deploy`, same working-dir
- `delulu-discord-deploy` — SSH droplet + rebuild container (no working-dir, SSH script does its own `cd`)

A `changes` job running `dorny/paths-filter` decides which of the
CI/CD jobs actually run via `if:` conditions on their respective
filter outputs. That's the path-filter mechanism — it's what makes a
docs-only PR skip both CI jobs and a bot-only PR skip the sandbox
jobs.

The per-app `working-directory` is how CI avoids the pre-commit
"walks upward looking for pyproject" trick: CI just `cd`s into the
app before it does anything, so `uv run ruff check .` picks up the
right config automatically.

## Branch protection + the skipped-job gotcha

GitHub's "Require status checks to pass before merging" rule expects
each listed check to have a success conclusion. The subtle thing:

- A check that **ran and passed** → satisfies the gate
- A check that **ran and failed** → blocks the merge
- A check that **was skipped** (paths filter said no) → does NOT
  satisfy the gate

So if you branch-protect `delulu-discord-ci` directly, a
sandbox-only PR can never merge: the discord CI skips because the
paths filter didn't match, and the gate never sees a passing check.

The standard fix is a **pass-through success job**:

```yaml
ci-complete:
  needs: [delulu-discord-ci, delulu-sandbox-modal-ci]
  if: always()
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: gate
      run: |
        if [[ "${{ needs.delulu-discord-ci.result }}" == "failure" ]]; then exit 1; fi
        if [[ "${{ needs.delulu-sandbox-modal-ci.result }}" == "failure" ]]; then exit 1; fi
        echo "CI complete"
```

Branch-protect only `ci-complete`. It always runs, it fails if any
required CI failed, and it passes if any combination of success and
skipped. That's the pattern for path-filtered monorepo CI.

(Not wired up yet; flagged as a follow-up for when branch protection
becomes important enough to bother with.)

## Walkthrough: a file edit, end-to-end

Edit `apps/delulu_discord/src/delulu_discord/handlers.py`:

```
# LOCAL — pre-commit catches lint at commit time (if installed)
git add handlers.py
git commit -m "fix: handle edge case"
  ↓ git invokes .git/hooks/pre-commit
  ↓ pre-commit runs modern ruff hook (matches apps/.*\.py)
  ↓ ruff reads apps/delulu_discord/pyproject.toml for rules
  ↓ auto-fixes what it can, blocks commit on what it can't

# LOCAL (optional) — reproduce CI before pushing
cd apps/delulu_discord && make check && make test
  ↓ runs the exact commands GH Actions runs
  ↓ uses apps/delulu_discord/.venv + its ruff + its pytest config

# REMOTE — push triggers the workflow
git push && gh pr create
  ↓ pull_request event fires delulu-deploy.yaml
  ↓ changes job: bot=true, sandbox=false
  ↓ delulu-discord-ci runs
    ↓ (cd apps/delulu_discord)
    ↓ uv sync --extra dev
    ↓ uv run ruff check .
    ↓ uv run ruff format --check .
    ↓ uv run pytest
  ↓ delulu-sandbox-modal-ci skipped (no sandbox changes)
  ↓ pr-title-lint runs (independent, all PRs)
  ↓ CD jobs skipped (pull_request event, not push)

# MERGE — branch protection decides
merge → main push → same workflow fires
  ↓ CI jobs run against the merge commit
  ↓ delulu-sandbox-modal-deploy skipped (sandbox_runtime filter says no)
  ↓ delulu-discord-deploy runs → SSH droplet → rebuild → restart
```

Four layers, same file, each with its own scope and its own config
resolution rules.

## Practical rules of thumb

1. **Install pre-commit once per clone:** `uvx pre-commit install`.
   Without this, none of the local lint catches anything — the
   config is dead config.
2. **Keep tool versions aligned across layers.** When bumping ruff
   in an app's `pyproject.toml`, bump `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in
   the same commit.
3. **Run locally what CI runs.** `cd apps/X && make check && make test`
   is the same four commands CI runs. Use it before pushing to avoid
   the CI-caught-it-first feedback loop.
4. **Don't put cross-app imports between `apps/delulu_discord/` and
   `apps/delulu_sandbox_modal/`.** They're independent Python
   projects, they can't import each other. Data crossing the
   boundary crosses via Modal function calls (runtime) or via a
   shared schema (design). If you need genuinely shared code, the
   right move is a third `apps/delulu_shared/` package that both
   depend on, not cross-reaching.
5. **The top-level `pyproject.toml` is LoRA's, not the monorepo's.**
   Don't add delulu deps to it. Don't run `uv sync` at the root and
   expect delulu to work.
6. **Per-app Makefiles are the source of truth** for "how do I
   check/test/build/deploy this app". The top-level `Makefile` is
   just a thin dispatcher that calls them.

## When this model breaks down

- **Genuinely cross-app refactors** (rare today — we've stayed
  strictly split). The fix is usually a shared package, not
  sidestepping the boundary.
- **Root-level CI checks that need to see multiple apps at once**
  (e.g. a license-header check, a cross-reference link checker).
  Add them as a separate job that doesn't `cd` into any app, and
  write them to be app-aware manually.
- **Shared tool versions drift silently.** The drift trap from
  "pre-commit in this monorepo" above. Catch it by occasionally
  running `grep -rn "ruff>=" apps/*/pyproject.toml .pre-commit-config.yaml`
  and checking they agree. Not automated today.
